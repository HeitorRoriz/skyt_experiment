# SKYT Metrics Summary Template
# This file defines the schema for collecting all experiment results for the paper
# Each row corresponds to one experiment block (e.g., single temperature sweep, model variant, or contract)

# Delta_rescue: Improvement in exact canon matches (R_anchor_post - R_anchor_pre)
R_raw,R_anchor_pre,R_anchor_post,Delta_rescue
